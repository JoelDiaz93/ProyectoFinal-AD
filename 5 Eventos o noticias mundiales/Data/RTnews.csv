Sometimes, when a couple breaks up, it's not that easy to divide up the possessions. This is especially true when the coupleMás are co-owners of a cryogenics lab. After her husband allegedly left to start a family with another woman, 59-year-old Valeria Udalova decided to take half of the company's stock.
Udalova's big brain move (literally) was to break into the Moscow lab and steal the frozen brains of people who'd paid tens of thousands of dollars to hopefully be brought back to life one day. Police are still looking for Udalova, and there are now concerns that the brains may have been damaged in transit.
However, theories that she smuggled the brains out under a really big hat are probably not true."

Decked out in a ‘Just Eat’Más uniform, the driver must have missed the first two words when told that the company was a delivery service for ‘fast food joints’.
London’s Metropolitan Special Constabulary tweeted out a picture of the boy and their weed bust, adding that he was ‘currently enjoying one of (their) fine en-suites.’
Perhaps the delivery dealer had devised some extra-lucrative scheme with an actual Just Eat courier to secure a second wave of income in the event that some of his customers got the munchies."

The video comes after rumors of his death had been circulatingMás for several months.
In the video, al-Zawahri referred to the 9/11 attackers as ‘holy warriors’ and ‘lions of Islam’, and celebrates the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, claiming US troops were defeated ‘with the help of God’.
It’s not clear whether this is recent footage, although mentions of a January attack on Russian troops in Syria confirm it was filmed this year. It’s notable that he didn’t mention the Taliban takeover of Kabul, meaning this could be relatively old footage, filmed in advance. Consequently, the Al-Qaeda chief’s current whereabouts and state of health remain unknown.
